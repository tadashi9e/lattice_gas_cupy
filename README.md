# Lattice gas cellular automata written in cupy

This is a simulation of flow in lattice gas cellular automata.

You can observe the formation of Karman vortices when a cylinder is placed in a uniform flow to the right.

- Flow upwards is represented in red.
- Flow downwards is represented in green.
- Flow to the left (or stagnation against the flow to the right) is represented in blue.
